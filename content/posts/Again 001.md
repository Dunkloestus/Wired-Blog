So I'm here again, rebuilding in a massive backlog of failures, one again and again there is still people cheering up on me
I was thinking could be a normalized depression field or this is normal in me I feel like I made so much progress only to see nothing out nothing new same view 
and now
I must go out because my time here is up? 
is been always up, no more of me here I guess.

I have so much fear of the unknow but i feel it calling it my name.

one more again and again.
