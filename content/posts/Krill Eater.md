Many species of ==whales, seals, penguins, fish, and squid== rely on krill for their survival.

But i think the image is a shrimp, anyway
I love Crustaceans, hard shells, lots of arms, everywhere.

So this small fella is so useful in quantities and we don't even understand how they even effect the whole global ecosystem, there is a pasive or a talent for a character I like in Dota 2, it's called Tidehunter, is a sea monster humanoid form but huge, well when you pick this pasive you start like a small fry and start gaining more size and strength.

I been always so fascinated by the mechanism of our ecosystem to move energy from inorganic to organic beings and move nutrients and life for the whole planet

# this is a image from space of plankton or phytoplankton not sure but . . . look at the size:

The small ones moves the energy all around the world using the seas as a network
everyday I imagine the co-existence between humans and nature so distant.

I feel we surpass long ago the breaking point not because the resources, because our collective knowledge doesn't care, the system is set to hit a wall or multiple ones and is on collision course what we can do?

I feel like a plankton doing stuff moving energy around for what porpoise? 
Maybe something bigger?
Just to feed a bigger fish?
who knows?
