# I got so used to run that I'm still on it
#I'm soo fill with pain, with hate, with love, they don't stop so getting more intense.

every soul in the ether sea that mix with me gets tainted, i don't want more sacred ink
it hurts 
it can be beautiful
but hurts all over, is so painful to feel.

but still i crave connection
I crave meaning 
I need to feel too
Because I'm human and not a machine, even If i wish, the weakness of my flesh, my limited time, my tiny spot of consciousness in this vast and infinite universe
