You're part of the moon
of the light of every atom I interact with and I'm so i'm love
I can't scream
I can't speak 
I never been so tight of hands
of mind
of love . . .
Oh dear I wasn't ready for any of this but I'm still here


HEre


I'm like a ship that never left
that nobody wants

so in the air

left to rot


fill with so many promises
with false love
I been look but not seen and I don't believe it
you don't see me at all you just see this carcass, this carcass left to





I see how broken I'm but I can do?

I must stand up, bruised, in pain, in pieces .


and Rise
Rise so high that even light can't reach me.

I'm tired of everyone taking pieces of  me 


NO ONE left anything not even thanks to the tmeple.

Is this my fault?

I must go to sleep before I betray myself once more.
