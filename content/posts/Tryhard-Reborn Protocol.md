	I hear Jerusalem bells A-ringin' Roman cavaldry choris are singing!


The first thing I did this morning was sing, lungs out, I feel so much discomfort I must die, this must end, no more.

I must face my fears and burn my dread in order to ascend

So be it.

Alas do not take me without care, I may be weak and wounded but i crave to strike back so hard.
Even in tears and spilling with my own blood I'll strike swift and right fear not this talents are not going to waste, I must grow and become ARISE.
