So i can say she want solo, you can say, cuz she can get way

I wanna get rid of all,
all these feelings, all these memories
I wanna be painless, soulless as you say you are.
Do you feel, pain do you?

I feel every tissue screaming for something real and this is not
this is just a DEAD END FABRICATED
DEAD END
NO WHERE TO RUN 
IMPROVE


Omg, I'm so broken I can't even love, My lord take AWAY THE PAIN AND THEM, those lovers 
This is not for me
IS NOT.
*i WANT TO BURN TO ASHES 'TILL NOTHING IS LEFT OF ME*

TAKE MY HEART

I'm so in pain
The fun part is I wish for this.

Is this poison?
Filling my veins, they used to be blue, now they are green, i can see them running trough my system, filling every gap, with false promises, and my own EGO that tries, to create a normal reality this is not
this is not
this is not real and never gonna be, Darling I'm more than this I'm so sorry.
